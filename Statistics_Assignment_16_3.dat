'''
In a class on 100 students, 80 students passed in all subjects, 10 failed in one subject, 7
failed in two subjects and 3 failed in three subjects. Find the probability distribution of
the variable for number of subjects a student from the given class has failed in.
'''

* Here total no of student is 100.
* If we categorize number of subjects , then who all are passed in all subjects means 0 failure.

So the probability distribution of 
1. 0 subject failure = 80/100 = 0.8
2. 1 subject failure = 10/100 = 0.1
3. 2 subject failure = 7/100  = 0.07
4. 3 subject failure = 3/100  = 0.03
